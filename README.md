# Visualizing Data Distribution using Bar Chart or Histogram

Task-01:

# 📌 Objective

The purpose of this task is to create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable. For this project, population data from the World Bank dataset has been used to demonstrate how to represent the distribution of variables such as ages or genders across different countries or years.

# 📂 Dataset

Source: World Bank Populations 

Description: The dataset provides population statistics by country and year. It is useful for demographic analysis and trend visualization.




# 📋 Tasks Performed

1. Data Acquisition

Downloaded population data from the World Bank

Loaded the dataset using Pandas



2. Data Preprocessing

Selected relevant columns (e.g., Country, Year, Population)

Handled missing values and filtered data for visualization



3. Visualization

Bar Chart: Showed population of top 10 most populated countries in a selected year

Histogram: Displayed distribution of population sizes across countries



4. Analysis

Identified global population trends

Observed outliers and clusters in population sizes




📊 Visualization Examples

📈 Bar Chart: Top 10 countries by population in 2022

📉 Histogram: Distribution of countries by population range


All plots are generated using Matplotlib and Seaborn for clear and informative visuals.
